# Active-Directory-Lab

Goals: Set up a Windows Server with Active Directory, user accounts, groups, and policies

I am going to show my thought process in this lab

Step 1: To make this lab possible you need to download virtualbox and you need to download windows server 2022 ISO file. After you download virtualbox, you have to drag the iso file into the virtualbox interface and it will be installed into virtual box.
The settings i went was 4GB Ram, 2 CPUs, and 60GB of disk space.
