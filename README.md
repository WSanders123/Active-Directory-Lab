# Active-Directory-Lab

Goals: Set up a Windows Server with Active Directory, user accounts, groups, and policies

I am going to show my thought process in this lab

Step 1: To make this lab possible you need to download virtualbox and you need to download windows server 2022 ISO file. After you download virtualbox, you have to drag the iso file into the virtualbox interface and it will be installed into virtual box.
The settings i went was 4GB Ram, 2 CPUs, and 60GB of disk space.

You will need to make sure you are downloading the right windows server 2022 iso, because i originally downloaded the core iso and it only showed the command line.
(should look like this)

You can see it is downloaded and showing here.

After opening it up and configuring the settings, you should get the administrator, you can make any password then it should be done. The screen should look like this when you open it up

Next you will log in with the password you chose, when you successfully logged in, the first thing that will popup is server manager.
